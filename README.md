# Nuclear Throne Together: T&R Storm
A Nuclear Throne Together mod which adds my (gun) fursona. Made as a fun activity to spend time with my partner over winter break. Not remotely closed to balanced for the game, but can be adjusted fairly simply if desired. All artwork in mod by me.

## How To Install:
1. Download and install Yellow Afterlife's Nuclear Throne Together mod found [here.](https://yellowafterlife.itch.io/nuclear-throne-together)
2. Drop the tnr5000 folder into `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Nuclear Throne\mods` (if there is no mods folder, just make one)
3. Once at the game's character select screen type: `/load tnr5000` and T&R Storm should load in to be selected.

## Balance: 
Who knew being a living gun makes you over powered (I am bad at balancing games). If you're unsatisfied with how T&R Storm plays, tweaking the damage is luckily fairly easy! there's four lines I would recommend editing: `66`, `67`, `115`, `116`
These lines contain the parameters: `buttStr` and `specdmg`
- `buttStr` increases damage by n*specdmg, where n is what `buttStr` is set too. Defualt is 2 and it is STRONG!!!
- `specdmg` is the base damage of the bullets of my special ability. Defualt is .75 and I would not recommend setting it higher if you are trying to balance things.


## Future Updates:
I'm fairly satisfied with the end result as it stands, most of what is missing is sprite work which I may or may not try to do (I am not an artist)
There are currently no planned updates, but if I change anything its most likely to just be adding in a few more sprites or tweaking damage
